\begin{abstract}
A Report compiled for the Alliance of Wealthy People who Dislike Tax, investigating the relationship between rates of taxation (measured as a percentage of GDP), regulatory environment (measured through the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business), and GDP per capita (measured in current US dollars). Data are for European and Central Asian countries for the year 2019.

Note that the scale for Ease of Doing Business is a rank order from most (1) to least (100) business-friendly. The relationship can be visualised in a scatter plot; the second plot provides country labels. Alpha has been reversed for the second plot (i.e. more business-friendly countries are shaded darker).
